# MSC-M5-Project
The objectives are to collect and preprocess property data, implement machine learning models for analysis, evaluate model performance, to identify significant market trends and finally to predict future property prices and demand.
The research questions I would like to address are:
1. What factors influence property prices in Hong Kong?
2. How accurately can machine learning predict future prices?
3. What trends can be identified from the data?
For more information as to ovrall objectives see the file "TH project proposal.docv"
This project uniquely applies advanced machine learning to the Hong Kong property market, offering deeper insights and more accurate predictions than traditional methods.
## To execute/run this project
1. Open the python code block in order 1 to 6 
2. Upload the dataset DatasetV2.csv
3. Upload the dataset Propertydataraw2.csv
4. Run code starting from 1 as at the end of each code block it saves a files which is used in the next code block
5. The file master_results.csv creates a running summary of the results of each machine learning model
## To Understand the probelsm and current ststus
1. Open the document called "771952 Disceration TH" which is a DRAFT report which shows current progress
